Imported Python's Random Library to use later in program.
Printed 20 asterisks.
Printed "Program 3 - Even or Odd" to show which homework assignment the program is running.
Printed 20 more asterisks.
Created variable "yourNum" to get the input of a random number from the user.
Created variable "myNum" that uses the random library to create a random number ranging from 0 to 20,000 (randrange).
Printed blank space (print ("")) to space things out and make the program look cleaner.
Printed "You entered: " followed by the yourNum variable to output what the user input.
Made an if statement that took the input of yourNum with the expression that if the remainder of yourNum divided by 2 was equal to 0, then your number was even.
(Troubleshooting) Took a few minutes to figure out the most efficient way to create the formula used for the if statement (yourNum % 2 == 0).
Printed "This is even" for if yourNum met all the requirements to make the if statement true.
Made else statement if yourNum didn't meet the requirements of the if statement.
Printed "this is odd" for the else statement to output if needed.
Printed another blank space to spread statements out.
Printed "I made: " followed by the myNum variable to output the random number (0-20,000) from earlier.
Made another if statement that took the random number generated by myNum with the expression that if the remainder of myNum divided by 2 was equal to 0, then myNum was even.
Printed "This is even" for if myNum met all the requirements to make the if statement true.
Made else statement if myNum didn't meet the requirements of the if statement.
Printed "this is odd" for the else statement to output if needed.
Printed another blank space.
Created an input to allow the user to press Enter to kill the program.
